# Prototype for V-rooms using Three.js
Simple project example using the ES6 modules of three.js.

---

After downloading the repository, execute `npm install` once in the root directory to install all dependencies.

You can then start a local server by using `npm start` and open `http://localhost:3000/app/` for testing.

The quality of the code is very much "prototype" but nevertheless the capabilities of Three.js are shown nicely.

There is one mayor bug that causes the program to slow down, this occurs when you hover over multiple rooms. Reloading the website fixes this I believe it has to do with how I implemented the GUI.label
